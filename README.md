# Parking Lot CRUD App in Go

This is a simple project I built to learn how to make a CRUD API in Go.  
It uses the [chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) router to handle HTTP requests.

## Features
- Works with parking places for different vehicle types (Motorcycle, Car, Truck)
- Add a vehicle to a parking place
- View parking status
- Remove a vehicle from a parking place

This project is only for learning and testing Go basics. It is not meant for real-world use.
